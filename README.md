# Homework 2: Word Alignment
The purpose of this task was to improve the alignment error rate as much as possible using IBM model 1 as baseline.

## Language:
Python

## Executing the program
To run the program you must specify the number of phrases that the model will take into account during training. To specify this number, type '-n' and the number of sentences as an integer.
```
python model1_imp.py -n 1000
```
The only mandatory parameter to run the program is the number of sentences '-n'. To check the other parameters and the default values, you can use the 'help' function.

## Help:
```
python model1_imp.py --help
```
